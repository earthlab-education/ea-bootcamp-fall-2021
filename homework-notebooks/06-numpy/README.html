<h2><strong>Grading</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your final push of changes to the Assignment 4 repository on GitHub.com<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>
            <span><em>before the deadline</em></span>
            <span>&nbsp;</span>
        </strong>will be graded as your submission for this part of the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The points for each component of the assignment are listed in the notebook in each markdown cell.</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT:
        <ul>
            <li>DO NOT remove cells that say "do not modify". This assignment is autograded. If you remove cells it will potentially impact your grade!</li>
            <li>Adding cells is just fine.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow notebook instructions carefully. Place answers and plots in the cells where you are instructed to place them.</li>
            <li>DO NOT RENAME THE NOTEBOOK: the autograder will not recognize your submission.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you are no longer downloading a template file from CANVAS nor uploading a completed notebook to CANVAS.&nbsp; Both of these tasks are completed using the git/GitHub workflow that has been outlined above.&nbsp;</p>
