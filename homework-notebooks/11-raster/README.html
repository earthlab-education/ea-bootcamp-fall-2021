<p>Fork this repository on GitHub.com (e.g. https://github.com/eastudent/bootcamp-2020-10-time-series-eastudent).</p>
<p>Then,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code>&nbsp;your fork to your local working environment (e.g. local computer or JupyterHub).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Complete assignment notebook (bootcamp-2020-10-time-series.ipynb)</strong></p>
<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code>,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, and&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin master</code> to send the changes to your fork on GitHub.com.</p>

<p>In the pull request, include the following:&nbsp;</p>
