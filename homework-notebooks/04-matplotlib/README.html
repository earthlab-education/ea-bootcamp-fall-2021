<p>Similar to last week, you will submit a completed Jupyter Notebook to the GitHub repository for Assignment 4 using your git/GitHub skills. Follow the steps below to get started. <strong>Please note that these steps are exactly the same whether you are using your local computer or the Jupyter Hub cloud platform.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on this link to accept the Assignment 4 template repository:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/LmXrfwy2">https://classroom.github.com/a/LmXrfwy2</a>
            </li>
            <li>This will create a new private repository that includes your <strong>Github.com</strong> username in the name of the repository: <strong>https://github.com/earthlab-education/bootcamp-2020-04-plots-yourusername</strong>.</li>
            <li>Inside of this repository is the assignment template that you need to complete for this assignment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the terminal, navigate to your desired working directory
        <ul>
            <li><strong>cd earth-analytics</strong></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Clone the <strong>bootcamp-2020-04-plots-yourusername</strong>repository to your working directory on your computer. hint:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>git clone <a href="https://github.com/earthlab-education/bootcamp-2020-04-plots-yourusername-yourusername">https://github.com/earthlab-education/bootcamp-2020-04-plots-yourusername</a></strong></li>
            <li>Note that you only have to complete steps 1-3 above just once, as a copy of the repository will now be on your computer.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>ea-bootcamp-04-get-started-matplotlib-yourusername</strong> directory using <strong>cd</strong> <strong>ea-bootcamp-04-get-started-matplotlib-yourusername</strong>).</li>
    <li>You can now add, commit, and push changes to the homework 4 notebook from your local clone to the copy of the Assignment 4 repository on GitHub.com as many times as desired until the assignment deadline.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Grading </strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your final push of changes to the Assignment 4 repository on GitHub.com <strong>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>before the deadline</em></span>
        </strong>will be graded as your submission for this part of the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The points for each component of the assignment are listed in the notebook in each markdown cell.</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT:
        <ul>
            <li>DO NOT remove cells that say "do not modify". This assignment is autograded. If you remove cells it will potentially impact your grade!</li>
            <li>Adding cells is just fine.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow notebook instructions carefully. Place answers and plots in the cells where you are instructed to place them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you are no longer downloading a template file from CANVAS nor uploading a completed notebook to CANVAS.&nbsp; Both of these tasks are completed using the git/GitHub workflow that has been outlined above.&nbsp;</p>
