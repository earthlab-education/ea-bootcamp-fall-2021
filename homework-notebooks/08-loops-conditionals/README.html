<h4><strong>1. Fork and Clone the repository owned by earthlab-education&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Recall that after you accept your assignment using the link above, GitHub will create an Assignment&nbsp; repository owned by earthlab-education (e.g. https://github.com/earthlab-education/bootcamp-2020-08-loops-your-user-name-here).</p>
<p>Fork this repository on GitHub.com so that you own a copy of it.&nbsp; (e.g. https://github.com/your-user-name/bootcamp-2020-08-loops-your-user-name).</p>
<p>Then,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> your fork the files to your local working environment (e.g. local computer or JupyterHub).&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>2. Complete assignment notebook</strong></h4>
<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code>,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, and&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin master</code> to send the changes to your fork on GitHub.com.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Submit a Pull Request</strong></h4>
<p>Submit a pull request from your fork to the repository owned by earthlab-education</p>
<p>In the pull request, include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>a succinct but descriptive title (i.e. the owner of the repository can easily tell what was completed in the pull request without needing to read the pull request comment)</li>
    <li>
        <p>additional details in the comment to describe what was completed in this pull request</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>4. Merge Your Pull Request</strong></h4>
<p>When you are ready to submit your assignment, you will merge your own pull request from your fork into the main repository owned by earthlab-education.&nbsp;</p>
