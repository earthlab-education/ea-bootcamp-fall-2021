<p>Assignment 1 consists of completion of the notebook titled ea-bootcamp-01-get-started-reproducible-science.ipynb (for 60 % of your grade) and<span>&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/65185/quizzes/123767" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.colorado.edu/api/v1/courses/65185/quizzes/123767" data-api-returntype="Quiz">a quiz on CANVAS</a>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>(for the remaining 40%).
</p>
<p>To complete assignment 1, be sure you have reviewed chapters 1 through 4 of the <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/">Intro to Earth Data Science</a> online textbook, which covers open reproducible science, bash, Jupyter Notebook, and Markdown.</p>
<p>In this portion of assignment 1, you will work with Markdown and Code cells in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>To get started with this portion of the assignment, download and extract the following zip file to your earth-analytics directory:&nbsp; <a class="instructure_file_link" title="ea-bootcamp-01-get-started-reproducible-science.zip" href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/65185/files/20949884/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.colorado.edu/api/v1/courses/65185/files/20949884" data-api-returntype="File">ea-bootcamp-01-get-started-reproducible-science.zip</a>
</p>
<p>Read the instructions for each question carefully to successfully complete the required tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you do not need to add anything for COLLABORATORS on the top of the notebook, which is only for group assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note: each time that you open the notebook file (.ipynb), please be sure to run the first Code cell</strong> that contains the following:</p>
<p>## Core imports needed for grading
    <br />import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    <br />import matplotcheck.notebook as nb
    <br />import matplotcheck.timeseries as ts
</p>
<p>Otherwise, your plot in a later question will not execute successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To submit this assignment, upload your completed Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to this assignment page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post questions on the <a href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/65185/discussion_topics/457100" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.colorado.edu/api/v1/courses/65185/discussion_topics/457100" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Discussion page for Assignment #1</a>.</p>
