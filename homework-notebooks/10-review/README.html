<p>Recall that after you accept your assignment using the link above, GitHub will create an Assignment 10 repository owned by earthlab-education (e.g. https://github.com/earthlab-education/bootcamp-2020-10-time-series-pandas-eastudent).</p>
<p>Fork this repository on GitHub.com (e.g. https://github.com/eastudent/bootcamp-2020-10-time-series-pandas-eastudent).</p>
<p>Then,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code>&nbsp;your fork to your local working environment (e.g. local computer or JupyterHub).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Create an assignment notebook </strong><strong>and populate the notebook per the instructions in the README.md of the assignment 10 repository.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Create a new Jupyter notebook called <strong>bootcamp-2020-10-time-series-pandas.ipynb</strong> and populate it with code needed to complete the instructions in the README.md of the assignment 10 repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code>,&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, and&nbsp;<code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin master</code> to send the new notebook to your fork on GitHub.com.</p>
